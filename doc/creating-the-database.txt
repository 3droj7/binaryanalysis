This document describes how the database for BAT should be created.

--------------------
NOTE: currently the database creation scripts are under reconstruction
(rewrite from sqlite to postgresql). This document describes the situation of
how the scripts will be used after the rewrite.
--------------------

1. download sources
2. install necessary tools
3. create meta files
4. start database server
5. configure database creation script
6. run database creation script


1. Download sources
-------------------

First you need to download sources. How to do this is out of scope of BAT.
Downloading can be done using a crawler, or by hand. You should store these
files in a directory. It is recommended to create one directory per "origin"
(for example: Linux kernel, KDE, etc.).

Linux distributions, like Debian, are a good start to get all the useful and
actively open source software for Linux.

2. Install necessary tools
--------------------------

If you want to create a database you will need the following tools installed:

* ctags
* xgettext
* GNU tar
* FOSSology (if you want to extract licenses) -- http://www.fossology.org/
* Ninka (if you want to extract licenses) -- https://github.com/dmgerman/ninka/
* python-tlsh (if you want TLSH checksums) -- https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh

python-tlsh is popping up in more and more distributions.

3. Create meta files
--------------------

There are a few meta files that need to be created in the directory with
downloaded sources. They need to be created in this order:

* SHA256SUM -- this is a file that, despite its name, contains several hashes
for each archive in a directory
* LIST -- main file used by the database creation script, lists package,
version, package name and origin
* MANIFESTS/* -- a directory with files with hashes for each file in an archive
* DOWNLOADURL -- a file with download URL of each package, plus project website


  Generating SHA256SUM

In the directory 'maintenance' there is a script called 'updatesha256sum.py'.
It can be invoked as follows:

$ python updatesha256sum.py -f /path/to/directory/with/files

This script will then generate a file called SHA256SUM in
/path/to/directory/with/files

Example:

$ python updatesha256sum.py -f /data/sources/kernel

By default in this file the following hashes will be recorded:

* SHA256
* MD5
* SHA1
* CRC32
* TLSH (if python-tlsh is installed)

Each line of the file is tab separated. The first line of the file describes
the hashes and order that are in the file.

  Generating LIST

In the directory 'maintenance' there is a script called 'generatelist.py'. It
can be invoked as follows:

$ python generatelist.py -f /path/to/directory/with/files -o origin

Example:

$ python generatelist.py -f /data/sources/gnome -o gnome

Output is printed on standard out and needs to be directed. It is also highly
recommended to sort the output first, for example:

$ python generatelist.py -f /data/sources/gnome -o gnome | sort > /data/sources/gnome/LIST

The script will output a line per package with the following
information (tab separated):

* package name
* version
* archive name
* origin

Only files with known archive extensions are included, for example:
  * tar.gz, tgz
  * zip, jar
  * tbz2, tar.bz2
  * etc.

The script tries to automatically split the archive name into a package name
and package version. This is not always easy, as there are many naming
conventions in use by several distributions and some distributions use different
names for packages. That is why it is necessary to manually check the output of
this script.

  Generating MANIFESTS/* files

First create a directory called "MANIFESTS" inside of the directory with sources:

$ mkdir /path/to/directory/with/files/MANIFESTS

A script called 'createmanifests.py' can be found in the directory
'maintenance'. This script unpacks each archive listed in the LIST file created
in the previous step, unpacks it, and computes checksums for each file found in
the archive and stores it as a bzip2 compressed file in the 'MANIFESTS'
directory.

The script can be invoked as follows:

$ python createmanifests -u -f /path/to/directory/with/files

for example:

$ python createmanifests.py -u -f /data/sources/gnome

The name of a file in the MANIFESTS directory is actually the sha256 checksum
of the file, to avoid duplication and work around the fact that sometimes
archives with different contents use the same name.


  Creating DOWNLOADURL file

The DOWNLOADURL file is optional, but it can be used to store useful metadata
about files in the database that is useful for for example reporting. This file
should have two fields per line, separated by a tab. The fields are are the
download URL of the archive (including the archive name), plus the website of
the project.

4. Start the database server
----------------------------

Before the database creation script can be run the database server needs to be
started.

5. configure database creation script
-------------------------------------

The database needs a configuration script.

6. run database creation script
-------------------------------
