This document describes how the database for BAT should be created.

1. download sources
2. install necessary tools
3. create meta files
4. start database server
5. configure database creation script
6. run database creation script


1. Download sources
-------------------

First you need to download sources. How to do this is out of scope of BAT.
Downloading can be done using a crawler, or by hand. You should store these
files in a directory. It is recommended to create one directory per "origin"
(for example: Linux kernel, KDE, etc.).

2. Install necessary tools
--------------------------

If you want to create a database you will need the following tools installed:

* ctags
* xgettext
* GNU tar
* FOSSology (if you want to extract licenses) -- http://www.fossology.org/
* Ninka (if you want to extract licenses) -- https://github.com/dmgerman/ninka/
* python-tlsh (if you want TLSH checksums) -- https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh

python-tlsh is popping up in more and more distributions.

3. Create meta files
--------------------

There are a few meta files that need to be created in the directory with downloaded sources.

* SHA256SUM -- this is a file that, despite its name, contains several hashes for each archive in a directory
* MANIFESTS/* -- a directory with files with hashes for each file in an archive
* DOWNLOADURL -- a file with download URL of each package, plus project website
* LIST -- main file used by the database creation script, lists package, version, package name and origin


  Generating SHA256SUM

In the directory 'maintenance' there is a script called 'updatesha256sum.py'. It can be invoked as follows:

$ python updatesha256sum.py -f /path/to/directory/with/files

This script will then generate a file called SHA256SUM in /path/to/directory/with/files
